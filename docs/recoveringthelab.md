Recovering the Lab
==================

With automation you are making an investment into the repeatability of your configuration steps. If you were to configure everything by hand then you will need to repeat the same steps by hand to recover a failure. With automation you will be able to repeat the configuration simply by rerunning your automation tools.

Initially the creation of tools requires an upfront investment of time greater than as if you were to configure something by hand. However you can quickly recoup the cost of automation by reusing the tooling several times. Their isn't an exact formula to determine the value of the time spent, however it can become quickly relevant once you have a nasty issue occur.
